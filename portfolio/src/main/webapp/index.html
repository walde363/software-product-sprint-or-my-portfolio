                <p>Robot Maker 2019, Developer January 2019–June 2019</p>
                <p>
                    Robot makers competition consists of creating prototypes of robot that meet the objectives of
                    sustainable
                    development
                    promoted by the United Nations (UN). Our team’s project was to develop a drone capable of deliver a
                    life
                    saver to a person
                    in distress in any type of body of water. My job was to make a litter research on servos and came
                    with
                    ideas
                    to install the
                    servo in the drone and install the life saver drop mechanism.

                    develop, and manufacture
                    an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using design lifecycle methodologies and processes with they will
                    indubitably encounter in a real-world work environment.
                    My role as a lead software engineer is to organize the software team. Supervise the tests and
                    validate
